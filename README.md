# About Website
The purpose of this website was to create an e-commerce platform upon Developer Items such as clothes, mugs, hoodies etc. Since there was no e-commerce companies which sell such as items in Turkey, we developed an idea to create this website where you can search items, create your user profile, add them to your cart and remove. You can add them to your favorite list. And You can sort by the catagory. Everything will be stored in local storage.
We used ReactJs, Commerce Js DB, ContextApi, Firebase for Login authentication, Bootstrap and CSS.
